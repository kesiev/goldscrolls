Periodically they send her 'love in writing' and lots of Gold, so that she can grow up healthy and strong to find the love of her life. Tabe, once eighteen, has instead decided to invest her parents' money in another way: create the largest spy network in the Empire to track and punish them in an exemplary way. While it's almost impossible to know where in the Empire they are, there is a day and a place they always show up: the day of the Goldscroll tournament held annually in the Capital.",
